  <h1>All about <strong>owls</strong></h1>
  <p>so you wanted to know about owls?</p>
  <p>Well I don't know anything. Here's a picture to keep you happy:</p>
  <img src="images/real-owl.jpg" alt="the picture I promised you could not be displayed. Did you expect me to keep my promise?">
  <p>So I decided that maybe I do know something about owls. In fact I decided to create a table to show you everything that I know about owls:</p>
  <hr>
  <table cellspacing="10" cellpadding="3">
    <thead>
      <th>Owl</th>
      <th>Important Features</th>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Snowy Owl</td>
        <td>Likes snow</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Tawny owl</td>
        <td>Tawny</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Barn owl</td>
        <td>Likes barns</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
